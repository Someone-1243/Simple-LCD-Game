# Simple-LCD-Game
A simple game coded for an Arduino Uno and designed to be played on a liquid crystal display. Made for TER4M1 course.

## How it Works
Based on games such as Jetpack Joyride, the player controls a character's vertical position by pressing and releasing a button to avoid obstacles. A score is tracked based on how long the player can avoid obstacles. The obstacles are randomly generated. Game speed increases as score increases.
